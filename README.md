# Instructions for running the code

This is the main repository (**Interflow**) where you will find the directory with the code of the native application (https://github.com/interflowrepo/interflow/tree/main/interflow-expo-rn)

In order to run the native application, you will need to create a new application within the directory
/interflow-expo-rn

execute the command yarn add expo npx expo install

After these two commands, you can start the expo application with the command:

npx expo start

Once the app is running, you can choose how you want to use it. To access all the features we developed during the hackathon, download the expo go app to your mobile phone and scan the code QR, which is on your terminal!

To test the created functionalities, you currently only need to run the native app. Our app uses 2 APIs:

- Node JS (https://github.com/interflowrepo/interflow-api)
- Go Lang (https://github.com/interflowrepo/interflow-wallet-api)

Both have been deployed and are active to receive requests.

**NOTE: We had some issues with gits repositories and conflicts. Over time we have made some changes and created new repositories to ease and avoid problems, [the history and explanation of this you can find in this link](https://github.com/interflowrepo/interflow-api/blob/main/HACKATON-HISTORY.md)**
