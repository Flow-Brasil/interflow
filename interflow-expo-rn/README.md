# Instructions for running the code

Execute the commands 

yarn add 
expo npx expo install

After these two commands, you can start the expo application with the command:

npx expo start

Once the app is running, you can choose how you want to use it. 
To access all the features we developed during the hackathon, download the expo go app to your mobile phone and scan the code QR, which is on your terminal!

*Some features only work on your device, e.g. avatar creation, push notifications..*

To test the created functionalities, you currently only need to run the native app. Our app uses 2 APIs:

- Node JS (https://github.com/interflowrepo/interflow-api)
- Go Lang (https://github.com/interflowrepo/interflow-wallet-api)

Both have been deployed and are active to receive requests.

**NOTE: We had some issues with gits repositories and conflicts. Over time we have made some changes and created new repositories to ease and avoid problems, [the history and explanation of this you can find in this link](https://github.com/interflowrepo/interflow-api/blob/main/HACKATON-HISTORY.md)**
